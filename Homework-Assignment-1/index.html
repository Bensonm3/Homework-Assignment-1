    <p1 class = "p1">I was born and raised in the Pacific Northwest, and attained a bachelors degree in Political Science from Western Washington University.
        Upon graduating I got a job at Costco Travel, and then worked as a Tax Accountant for a few years before joining the international buying office in 2018.
        Now I am taking the coding bootcamp to learn technical skills and to take a job as a developer upon graduation.

    <p2 class="p2">I like to spend most of my free time outside, usually either running or hiking. 
        In the past couple of years I have gotten more into trail races, competing in several each year during the summer. 
        The primary race distances I compete in are the 10K and half marathon. 
        In the past few years I have gotten into rock climbing as well.
        I climbed the Tooth up at Snoqualmie pass this past summer, which required technical rock climbing skills and protective gear placements.
        I also enjoy traveling in my spare time, the most recent destinations being Costa Rica, Australia, and New Zealand.

    <p3 class="p3">In this portfolio you will find some of the exciting projects I have been working on as part of my coding boot camp. 
        Also included is a contact window, thank you for stopping by!
